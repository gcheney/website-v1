This is my first version of my  personal website, made with a combination of a responsive, static HTML5 theme from [HTML5 Up](http://html5up.net/), a blog section powered by Jekyll and the [HPSTR Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme), and a ton of custom tweaking to combine the two. 

I have since moved to using just a single Jekyll-based site.
